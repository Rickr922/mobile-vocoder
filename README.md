# Vocoder App
Vocoder mobile app for Android made with Faust and its Smartkeyboard interface. This app was developed in the context of a project for the the Real Time Interaction and Performance exam (Sound and Music Computing MSc, Aalborg University, Copenhagen, 2020).

The paper *A Faust-built Mobile Vocoder Instrument*, included in the repo, provides more information on the algorithm, as well as the description of a case prototype.

To try the app, simply download and install the **Vocoder.apk** file on your Android device. Keep in mind that it is strongly suggested to use the app with an external speaker, or an external microphone.
